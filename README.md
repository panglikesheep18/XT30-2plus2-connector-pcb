# XT30-2plus2-connector-pcb

a PCB designed to keep small connectors from failing when attached

i made this PCB because i don't want to make makeshifts anymore 💀

# Features
- holds small (data) connectors of male side of XT30 2+2 so it cannot be slipped of connecting thus breaking the connector

- Holds 16AWG max. cables on main connectors and 24AWG max. on small (data) connectors

- 3 boards per panel idk but this hopes to not make PCB makers mad

# Usage
### 3D printers: swappable hotends (thermistor connects to small (data) connectors and the heater core connects to main connector)

### idk what extra usage are but data or sensing goes to small (data) connectors and powered load goes to main connector.

# Purchase assemblies
- i don't sell PCBs but you can send the gerber to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) or [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com)
- Also [some AMASS XT30 2+2s in AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003667017211.html)

# BOMs (not including solder and soldering iron)

##Things listed below can be found above (in "Purchase assemblies")

## Board (excluding cables and solder)
- 1X male side of XT30(2+2) or XT30U(2+2)

## Load (excluding cables and solder)
- 1X female side of XT30(2+2) or XT30APB(2+2)

# Assembly procedure
**Avoid pre-tinning the cable and PCB until the cable has fit through the board, unless you know what you're doing, otherwise you'll have a hard time solding the cable to the PCB.**

- fit cables to the PCB, make sure the cable going to the PCB is the one it connects, then solder cables to the board

- put the connector to the PCB, make sure it fits

- solder the connectors of XT30 2+2 and the PCB, Avoid heating it for too much as it will melt the connector and get the cable disconnected
